            <h2>Get Started</h2>
            <h4>The best way to start is just getting a single driver and learning how to
            throw that single disc. If you are able to spend $50, you will be able to get
            three discs, two putters that are are same weight, and a driver. This will allow
            you to practice consistent putting techniques, as well as getting the feel for
            throwing your putter longer distances as well for increased accuracy in your
            short game. Only having one driver will give you an opportunity to practice your forehand and 
            backhand drives and learn that discs flight pattern so that way you feel comfortable stepping up to the tee.
