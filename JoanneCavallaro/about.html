        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am a California native that lived in the Texas Hill country, right outside of Austin, for nineteen years.  My husband and I relocated to Dallas, Texas from California in 1992 with our  beautiful infant son, we transferred 
            to the Austin area in 1999. Circumstances recently brought me to the Pacific Northwest and the change of pace and climate could not be better!

            I’ve always been an artist, but I discovered my passion for acrylic pouring almost two years ago, I have never been so inspired by an art medium before.  I love how this style of painting requires me to to stay in the moment during the prep and actual pouring process.  I love the fact that every piece is one-of-a-kind and cannot be duplicated.  Everyone sees something different in each piece and nothing is ever created with a “sale” in mind.  My only goal with my work is to make the most beautiful art I can at that time on that day.

            Enjoy!
